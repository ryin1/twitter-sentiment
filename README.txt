Brief Description of Project Goals/Features:
Twitter Sentiment Analysis is deployed as a webapp on Flask, and has two options:
1. Given a Twitter username and an integer limit, our app takes the last tweets up to the limit of the username and graphs the sentiment score [-1, 1] of each tweet vs. time, displaying it on the page along with the Twitter userâ€™s profile picture.
2. Given a keyword query and an integer limit, our app checks the dynamically changing Twitter stream for tweets related to the keyword up to the limit and graphs the sentiment score [-1, 1] of each tweet vs. time.
